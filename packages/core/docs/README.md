# Meet Vue Storefront

Hi, nice to meet you (or see you again) ðŸ‘‹

If you are new to Vue Storefront, you should know that it's an **e-commerce frontend framework** based on [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). It can work with almost any API backend, allowing you to connect not only to e-commerce platforms but also headless CMS, auth providers, payment gateways, and much more.

If you need proof, see the list of ready-to-use [Integrations](/integrations/) that gets longer every month.

## Why Vue Storefront

### Extensibility

Our list of integrations is already long, but on top of it, there are hundreds of official and community-created [Nuxt Modules](https://modules.nuxtjs.org/). If you still haven't found the integration you were looking for, you can create your own, following the [Extending Vue Storefront](/integrate/extending-vue-storefront.html) guide.

### Short time to market

Thanks to all these integrations and modules, you will save hundreds (if not thousands) of hours, so you can focus on creating value for your product while we do the heavy lifting.

### Tech stack

The speed and flexibility of Vue Storefront wouldn't be possible without the great technologies that power it:

* [Vue.js 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide)
* [Nuxt.js 2](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started)
* [Storefront UI](https://www.storefrontui.io/) (optional)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home) (optional)

## Where to start

If you're already convinced to use Vue Storefront, follow the [Installation](./general/installation.html) guide to get started. However, if you want to learn more, check out the [Introduction](./getting-started/introduction.html) page.
